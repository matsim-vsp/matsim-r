# MATSIM R support package

MATSIM <https://matsim.org> is an agent-based microsimulation package for large-scape transport simulations. 

This package mimics the functionality of the [Python matsim-tools](https://pypi.org/project/matsim-tools) package, and will support standard MATSIM networks, plans and events. 

Currently network files are supported.

This work is ongoing and submissions are welcome!
