Title: R library for interfacing with MATSim agent-based microsimulation model
Version: 0.1.6

Description: MATSim support package for R
    MATSim <https://matsim.org> is an agent-based microsimulation package 
    for large-scale transport simulations. This package mimics the functionality 
    of the Python matsim-tools package, and thus supports reading standard 
    MATSim networks and soon, plans and events as well. 
 .
         Developed with support from the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin's
    VSP Transport Planning and Transport Telematics department. 
 .
         This project is under ongoing development and submissions are welcome!
