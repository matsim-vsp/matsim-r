Description: >-
    asdfasd MATSim support package for R. MATSim <https://matsim.org> is an
    agent-based microsimulation package for large-scale transport simulations.
    This package mimics the functionality of the Python matsim-tools package,
    and thus supports reading standard MATSim networks, plans, and events.

    This package is developed with support from Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, Transport Planning and Transport Telematics department, one of the primary creators of the MATSim microsimulation framework.
