### Introduction
Welcome to the matsim package! This vignette will guide you through the process of creating plots using the functions provided by our library. matsim is a powerful R package designed for data process and visualization, with providing a wide range of functions to create high-quality and adjustable plots from processed data.

#### Overall concept

The purpose of this package is to provide a comprehensive set of tools and functions for efficiently analyzing output of matsim simulations. The package primarily operates on output data stored in CSV files, specifically those named with the suffix "output_trips", "legs","persons". By adhering to this naming convention, the package offers streamlined functionality for reading, processing, plotting, and utilizing special features via YAML files used in Simwrapper(in development).

The package is organized into four main subcategories, each serving a specific purpose:

**Reading Functions**: These functions begin with the prefix "read_" and are designed to read and import the simulation output stored in CSV files. By leveraging these functions, users can easily load the necessary data into their R environment for further analysis.

**Processing Functions**: Functions with the prefix "process_" form the core of the package's data manipulation capabilities. Users can apply a variety of transformations and calculations to the loaded output_trips data, allowing for advanced processing and analysis tailored to their specific requirements. Additionally, the processing functionality extends beyond traditional tabular data, as it supports spatial input/output, enabling users to analyze and manipulate spatially referenced transport simulation data.

**Plotting Functions**: With the prefix "plot_," the plotting functions enable users to create insightful visualizations based on the processed output data. These functions offer a range of plotting options, empowering users to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the transport simulation results. The plotting functions encompass two additional subcategories, namely mapping and comparing. Within the mapping subcategory, users can generate visualizations that overlay simulation results onto geographical maps, providing insights into spatial patterns and distributions. The comparing subcategory offers tools to compare different simulation outputs, facilitating analysis and understanding of variations between scenarios or datasets.

**Simwrapper**: The simwrapper is a specialized block within the package that facilitates plotting using YAML files in Simwrapper. This feature allows users to define complex plots and visualizations in YAML format, providing a convenient and efficient way to generate custom visual representations of their simulation data.

By following this design philosophy and offering a well-structured collection of functions, matsim R package aims to simplify the analysis of transport simulations. It provides users with an intuitive workflow, from reading and processing the simulation output to generating informative plots and leveraging the power of YAML-based configurations.

#### Installation
Matsim is not still available at CRAN, so to install matsim we use github, you can use the following code:

```{r install master,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("matsim-vsp/matsim-r")
```
However if you want to have some specific branch in your Rstudio you can specify this branch in the code:
```{r install ref,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("matsim-vsp/matsim-r", ref = "{name of the branch}")
```
#### Loading the package
Once installed, you can load the matsim package using the library() function:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(matsim)
```



#### Loading Data

The first step in analyzing your transport simulations is to load the output data into your R environment. matsim provides convenient functions with the "read_" prefix for this purpose. Let's take a look at how you can load your simulation output stored in a CSV file:

```{r reading, warning=FALSE,eval = FALSE}
# Specify the file path to your simulation output. 
# It can be directory path, or direct path to file
output_file <- "path/to/your/output_trips.csv"

# Use the read_csv_trips() function to read the simulation data
trips_data <- read_output_trips(output_file)
```

You can now proceed to explore and analyze the loaded data.


#### Data Processing

Matsim offers a range of processing functions, prefixed with "process_", to manipulate and transform your simulation data. These functions allow you to perform various operations, such as filtering, aggregating, and calculating additional metrics. Let's see an example of applying a transformation to our loaded data:

```{r processing, warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
# Filter the trips data to include only weekday trips
#weekday_trips <- process_filter_by_shape(trips_data)

# Calculate the average trip duration
#average_duration <- process_calculate_average_duration(weekday_trips)
```

Feel free to explore the different processing functions available in the package to suit your specific analysis requirements.

#### Plotting

Visualizing your simulation data is crucial for gaining insights and effectively communicating your findings. your_package_name provides a wide range of plotting functions to help you create informative visualizations. Let's create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between trip distance and trip duration:


```{r plotting, eval = FALSE}
# Create a scatter plot of trip distance against trip duration
#plot_scatter(trips_data, x = "distance", y = "duration")
```

ou can customize the plot appearance and explore other plot types, such as line plots, bar charts, and spatial maps, using the various plotting functions provided by matsim.


#### Advanced Features (still in development)

In addition to the fundamental functionalities discussed above, your_package_name offers advanced features to enhance your analysis. For example, you can utilize YAML files in the simwrapper block to define complex plots and visualizations. This allows you to create sophisticated and customized outputs to meet your specific requirements.


#### Conclusion

In this vignette, we introduced you to the matsim package, designed specifically for analyzing transport simulations. We hope that you'll have great experience using this library, and we are glad to receive feedback based on your use of package on **some mail/github **
