#### Introduction

This vignette offers an example workflow from MATSim output to thematic plots and maps. For a general overview of the package and its structure please read XXX LINK OTHER VIGNETTE XXX.

A short recap however: functions are divided into four categories and start with a respective prefix. Read_, process_, plot_ or compare_ and in the future simwrapper_.
To better understand the naming conventions (for example to create your own functions) consult XXXX LINK TO VIGNETTE XXXX.

#### Installation

MATSim R is not yet available at CRAN, so to install MATSim R using github use the following code.

```{r install master,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("matsim-vsp/matsim-r")
```

#### Loading the package
Once installed, you can load the MATSim R package using the library() function:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(matsim)
```

#### Loading data

The data we'll use in this example project is the result of a Leipzig run which you can find under the following link. XXX MAKE LINK NICE XXX https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/countries/de/leipzig/projects/namav/base-case/

The shape file can be found here:
https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/countries/de/leipzig/leipzig-v1.1/input/shp/

If you want to follow along, download a copy of the folder.

To start we will load the output_trips.csv.gz file. It is a zipped file but that is okay, the functions can handle that. We will also load a shape file.
```{r,eval=FALSE}

 trips_file_path <- "paste_file_path_here"
 
 # if you don't want to immediately load the whole file, the function read_output_trips has the option to only load the first n lines 
 output_trips <- read_output_trips(trips_file_path, n_max = 5000)
```

#### Plot a modal split

There are two functions to calculate and plot modal splits: plot_mainmode_piechart() and plot_mainmode_piechart(). As the name suggests the first one plots the modal split as a pie chart and the second one as a bar chart. To do this, they use the processing function process_get_mainmode_distribution() and plot the resulting table. The processing function can also be used on its own to just get the raw numbers.

We are going to plot a bar chart:

```{r,eval=FALSE}

 plot_mainmode_barchart(output_trips)

```

The resulting bar chart looks like this:

![Leipzig modal split](../inst/extdata/Leipzig_modal_split.png)
#### Spatial filter

In a next step we want to spatially filter our data. So far we have been looking at all the trips in the simulation, now we want to focus on those that touch our project area.

To do this we can use the function process_filter_by_shape() and the shape file we've already loaded. The parameter crs is the coordinate system number and the spatial_type describes the way the trips interact with the project area. The four options are inside, outside, originating and destinating. In this case we will look at the originating trips.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
trips_originating <- process_filter_by_shape(output_trips, leipzig_shp, crs = 25832, spatial_type = "originating" )
```

Using plot_mainmode_barchart() once more on the 507 originating trips, results in the following chart:

![Leipzig modal split - trips originating in project area](../inst/extdata/Leipzig_modalsplit_originating.png)

#### Comparison plots

In a next step we will compare the modal split of this base model with the modal split of a scenario. To do this we need to load the output_trips file from a scenario, e.g. this one. https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/countries/de/leipzig/projects/namav/drt-outskirts/ XXXX NICE LINK XXXX

```{r, eval = FALSE}

output_trips_scenario <- read_output_trips(trips_file_scenario_path, n_max = 5000)

trips_scenario_originating <- process_filter_by_shape(output_trips_scenario, leipzig_shp, crs = 25832, spatial_type = "originating")

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE,eval = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
