```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup, warning = FALSE}
library(matsim)
```

#### Introduction

This vignette offers an example workflow from MATSim output to thematic plots and maps. For a general overview of the package and its structure please read XXX LINK OTHER VIGNETTE XXX.

A short recap however: functions are divided into four categories and start with a respective prefix. Read_, process_, plot_ or compare_ and in the future simwrapper_.
To better understand the naming conventions (for example to create your own functions) consult XXXX LINK TO VIGNETTE XXXX.

#### Installation

MATSim R is not yet available at CRAN, so to install MATSim R using github use the following code.

```{r install master,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("matsim-vsp/matsim-r")
```

#### Loading the package
Once installed, you can load the MATSim R package using the library() function:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(matsim)
```

#### Loading data

The data we'll use in this example project is the result of a Leipzig run which you can find under the following link. XXX MAKE LINK NICE XXX https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/matsim/scenarios/countries/de/leipzig/projects/namav/base-case/

If you want to follow along, download a copy of the folder.

To start we will load the output_trips.csv.gz file. It is a zipped file but that is okay, the functions can handle that.
```{r,eval=FALSE}

 trips_file_path <- "paste_file_path_here"
 
 # if you don't want to immediately load the whole file, the function read_output_trips has the option to only load the first n lines 
 output_trips <- read_output_trips(trips_file_path, n_max = 5000)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
