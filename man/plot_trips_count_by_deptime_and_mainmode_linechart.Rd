\usage{
plot_trips_count_by_deptime_and_mainmode_linechart(
  trips_table,
  unite.columns = character(0),
  united.name = "united"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{united.name}{character string, specifies the name of the united mode}

\item{tripsTable}{tibble of trips_output (from readTripsTable())}

\item{unite.modes}{vector of character strings,
changes names of chosen modes in the column main_mode to a new chosen name (i.e. drtNorth and drtSouth to drt),
using the function (\link{process_rename_mainmodes})}
}
\value{
Line plot of trips count by departure time per mode
}
\description{
Takes data frame trips_output (from \link{readTripsTable()}),
to create a line plot of the number of trips for a specific departure time by main_mode
Using the parameter unite.modes, specific modes can be renamed into one with the name specified with united.name (by default 'united')
}
